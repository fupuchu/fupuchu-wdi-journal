Notes/Thoughts from each day

## Hello World!
### 30/05/2018
Introduction to the program, what we're going to cover and first mental block with conditionals. Ran into problems when trying to understand modulo. Trying to get into habit of using pseudo code more.

There are always more than one way to solve an issue.


## Loop de Loop
### 31/05/2018
Did some loops at old company before, akira showed some different methods of looping which greatly helped in understanding different ways to loop through an array. Can't wait to start looping through JSON soon.

## Recursive looping with Functions
### 01/06/2018

Function takes in parameters and gives output
You can store a function in an array and call the array[0]

Recursive Looping is looping without using for loops

It's important to use a break condition to stop the loop from happening just like in forloops but in this case it's provided in a Function
